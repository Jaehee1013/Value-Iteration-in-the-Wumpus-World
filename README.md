# Value-Iteration-in-the-Wumpus-World
In this problem, we focus on applying Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and the Value Iteration algorithm to the Wumpus World scenario. The objective is to implement two functions, MDP_value_iteration() and MDP_policy(), for a 4x4 grid Wumpus World. The goal is to control the agent within this environment and achieve specific objectives.
